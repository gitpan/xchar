xchar, version 0.2

Copyright (C) 2006-2007 Brian Keck.  All rights reserved.  This module
is free software; you can redistribute and/or modify it under the same

For a description of xchar see firstly xchar.pod in this directory
(xchar-0.2), which becomes xchar(1) after installation.

Prerequisites are Tk and X11::Protocol.

Install in the usual way:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	sudo make install

The 'make test' is useless currently.

If you suspect that you might not like xchar, & like to keep your system
spotless, you might want to save the output of

	make uninstall

which does nothing but output a list of files to delete.

If you're impatient a quick way to start is:

	mk.xtb > ~/.xtb
	mk.xscreens > ~/.xscreens

At this point you should be able to run xtb from the command line, and
raise & move windows via xup & xmv.

Getting keyboard mappings to do this (without which there's no point to
xchar) is sadly still a bit of work, and depends on your window manager.

If you happen to be using fvwm, you can do most of the work with:

	mk.xchar fvwm >> $FVWMRC

where FVWMRC is ~/.fvwm/config or ~/.fvwmrc.

However, these fvwm key mappings assume that mod3 (xup) & mod4 (xmv) are
not used for something else, and have had keys assigned to them.  I do
this in my .xinitrc file.  On my Sony TX laptop I use respectively the
key with the picture of a menu and the key with the mswin logo:

        xmodmap \
          -e 'keycode 115 = Super_L' \
          -e 'keycode 117 = Super_R' \
          -e 'add mod4 = Super_L' \
          -e 'add mod3 = Super_R'

On my Sun Ultra 10 with Sun 5c keyboard I use respectively the right & left
keys marked with a diamond:

        xmodmap \
          -e 'keycode 115 = Super_L' \
          -e 'keycode 116 = Super_R' \
          -e 'add mod3 = Super_R' \
          -e 'add mod4 = Super_L'

If you don't use fvwm then, instead of the last step, look at the output
of 'mk.xchar fvwm' & create similar key mappings for your window
manager, and send them to me so I can add them to mk.xchar.  Maybe some
xmodmaps will be needed as well.
