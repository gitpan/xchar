xchar, version 0.1

Copyright (C) 2006-2007 Brian Keck.  All rights reserved.  This module
is free software; you can redistribute and/or modify it under the same
terms as Perl itself.

For a description of xchar see firstly xchar.pod in this directory
(xchar-n.n), which becomes xchar(1) after installation.

Prerequisites are Tk and X11::Protocol.

Install in the usual way:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install 

The 'make test' is useless currently.

If you're impatient, & happen to be using fvwm, a quick way to start is:

	mk.xtb > ~/.xtb
	mk.xscreens > ~/.xscreens
	mk.xchar fvwm >> $FVWMRC

where FVWMRC is ~/.fvwm/config or ~/.fvwmrc.

If you don't use fvwm, instead of the last step, look at the output of
'mk.xchar fvwm' & create similar key mappings for your window manager.
